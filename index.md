## How It Works

Every character is built from a **Character Type**, which defines:
- Animations and required spritesheet size.  
- An optional Animator Controller
- Character layers if using the layered character type.

Once the Character Type is set up:
1. New characters can be made by creating a character template and assigning the new spritesheet or dynamically creating new characters at runtime.
2. If used, one Animator Controller can be used for all characters of the same character type. 

### Character Type Variants

| Type                       | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Layered Character Type](xref:layered-character-type) | Multiple spritesheets (e.g., Body, Hair, Outfit, Accessory) combined at runtime. |
| [Unified Character Type](xref:unified-character-type) | A single preassembled spritesheet for the whole character.                       |
