# LimeZu Modern Interiors Support

Don't know who LimeZu is? Check him out [here](https://limezu.itch.io/)! He's an insanely talented and dedicated man.

Fun fact, the **BlazerTech Character Management System** was originally planned to be a support tool for **Modern Interiors**. Then I got bigger ideas for it and it branched off into it's own thing.

However because of that the Character Management System provides an easy implementation for the modular characters within **Modern Interiors** and **Modern Farm**.

LimeZus characters are modular, meaning they're built of multiple layers that when put on top of each other form a finished character. This is exactly how Layered Characters work in the Character Management System.
