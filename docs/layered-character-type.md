# Layered Character Type
A layered character is made from multiple layers, these layers are stacked upon each other to form the final character.  
Ex: **Body > Outfit > Hairstyle > Accessory** - Each layer is added one by one in order.

---

## Creating a Layered Character Type
to create a new layered character type right click the **Project** window and navigate to **Create > BlazerTech > Character Management System > Layered Character Type**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Layered Character Type Scriptable Object** MUST be placed inside a folder named **Resources**! This is need for runtime initialization.

### Setting up Character Layers

At the bottom of your **Layered Character Type** is a list of **Character Layers**. Each layer is a **Scriptable Object** that contains all available options for that layer of your character.

Refer to [Character Layers](character-layers.md) for how to create and setup character layers.
