# Tab Layer Selector

A **Tab Layer Selector** won't do much on it's own. It must be paired with another **Layer Selector**. When a Tab Layer Selector is pressed it will change the selected layer in the [Character Layer Selection Manager](xref:ccm-layer-selector-setup#character-layer-selection-manager) which can then be used to change the assigned layer of another selector.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Tab Layer Selector** was designed to work with [Grid Layer Selectors](xref:ccm-grid-layer-selector) & [List Layer Selectors](xref:ccm-list-layer-selector) originally but can work with any **Layer Selector**.

## Prefabs

> [!TIP]
> Location: **Prefabs > Character Creator > Layer Selectors > Tab Selector**

### Layer Selector Prefabs
- **Layer Tab Selector** – Basic tab selector (Just a button).

### Pre-Setup Prefabs
Pre-setup prefabs already include a [Character Layer Selection Manager](xref:ccm-layer-selector-setup#character-layer-selection-manager).  
These will work out of the box without any extra setup required.

- **Dropdown Selectors [Initialize Existing]** – Uses tab selectors already present in the prefab hierarchy.  

> [!NOTE]
> No [Auto Create] variant is available for **tab layer selectors** because they require a reference to the [Character Layer Selection Manager](xref:ccm-layer-selector-setup#character-layer-selection-manager) which must be set manually. This means they **cannot** be created automatically at runtime.

## Setting up the second Layer Selector
The `CCMSelectedlayerTabHandler` component can be used to change the assigned layer of another selector to the one selected in the [Character Layer Selection Manager](xref:ccm-layer-selector-setup#character-layer-selection-manager).  
It takes two references:
1. **Character Layer Selection Manager** - Used to detect when the selected layer has been changed.
2. **Layer Selector** - Any type of layer selector can be used. It will automatically be updated to use the layer selected in the [Character Layer Selection Manager](xref:ccm-layer-selector-setup#character-layer-selection-manager).

## Customization

- **Styling** The tab layer selector can be freely modified (Change background sprite, font, colors, etc).
