# Character Creator Setup

## Premade Character Creation Menus

The easiest solution is to use a premade character creation menu. These prefabs contain everything needed for a functional Character Creation Menu.
At bare minimum they contain the following:
- **Layer Selectors** - Used to change layers of the character.
- **Character preview** - Used to preview the character while editing.
- **Save & Back Buttons**.
