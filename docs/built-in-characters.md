Sample modular characters are included within the **BlazerTech Character Management System**. These characters were made to match the style of the [Modern Series](https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors) created by [LimeZu](https://limezu.itch.io/).

These characters are modular and consist of 4 layers:
1. **Body (7 Options)**
2. **Outfit (28 Options)**
3. **Hairstyle (28 Options)**
4. **Accessory (29 Options)**

A **Layered Character Type** and **Unified Character Type** are pre-setup in the **/BlazerTech Modular Characters** subfolder.
The **Unified Character Type** contains a few premade characters created by combining random options of each of the 4 layers.

> [!TIP]
> Upon the full release of the **BlazerTech Character Management System** these characters will also be available for purchase separately at a discounted price.
