# Character Usage

The **BlazerTech Character Management System** includes the runtime components needed to **load**, **render**, **animate** and **control** characters.

| Component Type                            | Purpose                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Character Renderer components**         | Load and render a character.                                                                             |
| **Character Animator Handler components** | Control specific **paramters** set in an **Animator Controller** used to properly animate the character. |
| **Character Movement components**         | Handle player input and movement logic.                                                                  |

## The Character Shader

A shader is used to visually display a character over the **Base Spritesheet**.  
Sprites from the **Base Spritesheet** assigned in a **Character Type** are rendered in a component such as a **Sprite Renderer** or used in an **Animator Controller**.

If a **Unified Character** is used, the shader takes the single spritesheet of the character and shows that over the **Base Spritesheet**.  
If a **Layered Character** is used, the shader combines all layers into the final rendered character.  

> [!NOTE]
> If a **Character Renderer** component is used the shader will be applied automatically.

## Character Renderer Components

Character Renderer components will load and display any character regardless of the type

### Components

| Renderer Component                                                          | Used For                                                                 |

## Layered Character Renderers

### Layered Character Group Renderer

- **Component**: [LayeredCharacterGroupRenderer](xref:BlazerTech.CharacterManagement.Components.LayeredCharacterGroupRenderer).  

**Requirements:**  
- A [Layered Character Type](xref:layered-character-type).  
- At least one **Layered Character** saved in a group.  

[Read More â†’ Character Groups](xref:character-grouping-system)

The **Layered Character Group Renderer** component renderers a previously saved **Layered Character** from a **Character Group**.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Add the component to a GameObject.

2. optionally assign **Animator**.
3. Configure Loading Settings.
5. Assign the **Character Type** you want to load a character from.
6. Select the **Character Group** (Primary, Flexible or Fixed) and configure parameters.

#### Character Groups
After a **Character Type** has been referenced, you can choose which group you want to load a **Layered Character** from:

| Group Type                 | Description                                                                                           |
