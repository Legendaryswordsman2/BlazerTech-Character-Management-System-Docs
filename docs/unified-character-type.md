# Unified Character Type
A Unified Character is made of one single spritesheet which contains every animation of the character.

## Creating a Layered Character Type
to create a new layered character type right click the **Project** window and navigate to **Create > BlazerTech Character Management System > Unified Character Type**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Unified Character Type Scriptable Object** does **NOT** need to be placed inside a Resources folder unlike **Layered Character Types**.

### Setting up a Unified Character Type
The following properties must be set:

| Property                | Type                      | Description
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------
| **[CharacterTypeID](xref:character-type-core#charactertypeid)**         | String                    | A **unique** identifer
| **[BaseSpritesheet](xref:character-type-core#basespritesheet)**         | Sprite                    | The default character spritesheet
| **[CharacterController](xref:character-type-core#charactercontroller)** | RuntimeAnimatorController | The Animator Controller used

That's it! Once your **Unified Character Type** is all setup you can create a **Unified Character Template** to make characters from this **Character Type**.
