Configure when **Character Groups** are automatically saved to disk.

### Auto Save Triggers

A multi-select dropdown defining the events that trigger automatic saves.

| Option                     | Description                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Game Exit**              | Saves all character groups when the application quits.                                     |
| **Character Creator Save** | Saves all character groups whenever a character is saved from the Character Creation Menu. |
| **Scene Change**           | Saves all character groups when the active scene changes.                                  |

### Save Format

Select the format used when **Character Groups** are saved to disk.

| Format             | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JSON (Default)** | Human-readable format (`.json`). Easy to open and manually edit.              |
| **Binary**         | Compact binary format (`.bin`). Almost impossible to read or modify manually. |

> [!NOTE]
> Binary saves are more secure against tampering, while JSON saves are ideal during development and debugging.

## Active Character Types

The **Active Character Types** list contains all **Character Type assets** that are enabled and ready to be used at runtime.

When a new Character Type is created, the user is prompted to add it to the **Active Character Types list** before proceeding.
